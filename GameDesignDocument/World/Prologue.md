# Prologue

The Humanity was destroyed by Plague and lone survivals have been slept thousands years.
And after centuries Plague disappear. The Guardian Biological system sent a signal
and cryocameras are opened.

You are one of survivals. The World is dead and dangerous. We have functional Robo Engineering
workshop and couple transport drones. But your resource is wasted.

Old enemies are weak too, but who knows and maybe we get new enemies.
With existing drones we will explore bunkers for resources and new "old" technologies.
