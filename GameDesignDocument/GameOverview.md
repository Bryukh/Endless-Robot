## Philosophy

Today we automatize more and more processes. Autonomous drones is reality now.
In "ER" our main goal is prepare various drones for unexpected situations.

Don't waste time to routines as farming or same battles.
The player take strategic decision as where to send, who to send, how equip it, how should robot
act for various cases and solve mind-twisted puzzles.

Intellect is our main weapon.
