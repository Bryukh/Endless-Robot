# Game Overview

## Main Line

"Endless Robot" (or ER) is a game similar to Diablo
with endless randomly generated areas and items, arena and PvP battles,
 many playable characters with various skills.
But! The Player CAN NOT directly manage characters.
Player can prepare algorithms for exploring, battling, picklocking, trading, etc
and launch the robot to dungeon or arena.
Then Player only observes and waits.
The Game flow happens without a Playerâ€™s presence and a Player can call the robot,
requip it, upgrade with earned money and experience and launch at next run at any time.

## Philosophy

Today we automatize more and more processes. Autonomous drones is a reality now. In "ER" our main goal is to prepare various drones for unexpected situations.

Don't waste your time on routines such as as farming or similar battles. The player takes strategic decision such as where to send, who to send, how to equip it, how should robot act in various cases and solve mind-twisted puzzles.

Players can play 15 minutes in day or by 5 minutes breaks to check robot status and loot and
manage it with basic algorithms. Or player can analyze and examine each step and improve and improve
robots to speed up "basic" player progress. This way Hardcore gamers and casual players will
find interest in the Game. 

Intellect is our main weapon.
